"# EE-465-Capstone" 
For the Capstone Project Simulation you must:
1. create a copy of the folders shown in the Git.
2. open visual studios with the platform IO extension installed.
3. Click the ant Icon and wait for it to load
4. While connected to the Arduino Uno
5. Go to File Open Folder
6. Open the folder called building Info located in the Arduino Folder
7. Make sure you are are on the Ant icon tab and Hit the build function.
8. Once that action is shown as successfully completed in the terminal window.
9. Hit the Upload and Monitor function in the Ant icon tab under Arduino Folder in the project tasks window of visual studios.
10. Once that task has successfuly completed your arduino should be able to change the LED lights and output the incoming data stream in the terminal window of visual studios.
11. While connected to the ESP32:
12. Go to File -> New Window
13. open the folder called esp32 from the main folder
14. Make sure you are are on the Ant icon tab and Hit the Upload File System Image (Do this everytime you change the code)
15. Once that action is shown as successfully completed in the terminal window.
16. Hit the Upload and Monitor function in the Ant icon tab under Arduino Folder in the project tasks window of visual studios.
17. Once that task has successfuly completed your ESP32 should now have a public wifi network availible to connect where you can control the Arbiter Power Control System (APC) Manually
18.  and you should see the data output of each of the buildings in the terminal window of visual studios.
